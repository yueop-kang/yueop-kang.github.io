# MY PROFILE

I'm Yu-Eop Kang, Ph.D. Candidate at Seoul National University. My research interest lies in applying ML/AI to address challenges in aerodynamic data processing, with experience spanning both experimental and numerical data. I focus on enhancing the efficiency of traditional systems, particularly in areas such as data processing, aerodynamic modeling, and shape optimization. My primary approach involves data-driven reduced-order modeling (ROM), which is essential for the efficient processing and analysis of high-dimensional data. Recently, my research has expanded to include geometric parameterization using generative AI and the development of reliable surrogate models for efficient design optimization.


Research highlights:
1) Data processing of climatic wind tunnel test data using ML, including image processing and sparse reconstruction.
2) Development of reduced-order modeling algorithms to improve the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.
3) Development of an efficient framework for aerodynamic shape optimisation using generative modelling and surrogate models.
